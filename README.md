## 🔄 Steps & Implementation

### 🧹 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Scraped data using Python APIs (Reddit & YouTube).
- Applied preprocessing steps:
  - Lowercasing, punctuation cleanup
  - URL & retweet removal
  - Language detection (filtered for English)
  - Kept only comments > 10 characters

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Bar charts of **top commenters**
- **Word frequency analysis** using Counter
- **Word cloud visualizations** of top terms

### 🧠 Topic Modeling - LDA
- Used **Gensim's LDA** on preprocessed comments
- Displayed most dominant keywords for each topic
- Evaluated using **Coherence Score** and **Perplexity**
- Visualized topic distributions across comments

### 😃 Sentiment Analysis
- Used **VADER** (from NLTK) to compute sentiment scores:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Negative
- Visualized sentiment distributions using histograms
