So the world did get plenty of demonstrations of the AC technology before.

Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky built the first full 3 phase AC generation and distribution system in the 1888-1891 period.

Roger Williams was also a student of Sir Edward Coke before Roger Williams came to America in 1630 and introduced The Separation of Church & State onboard The Lyon in 1631. Encyclopedia Britannica states that there were only 25 thousand Catholics in 1776 out of a population of 4.5 million. The PEW Research Center say 5% sharing graphs on what the changes were. Of course, most people don't realize that a Separatist Movement led to The American Revolution. Most Separatists were Protestant Church Denominations, and our Pilgrim Fathers also had a quest for religious freedom shared also by our U.S. Founding Fathers. Of course, that all stems from The European Persecutions sparked by John Rogers, The First Protestant Martyr of Many executed by Queen Mary I also known as Mary Tudor or Bloody Mary, the daughter of King Henry VIII and Queen Catherine of Aragon (Catholic). Of course, King Henry VIII's 2nd wife, Queen Anne Boleyn was Protestant influenced by William Tyndale and Martin Luther.

You speak about cartels, but omit that your BOY donnie didn't do a dam* thing when the cartels murdered and fried AMERICAN MORMON WOMEN AND CHILDREN just across the border. Can you recall that, or do you like to block that, just like all FAKE republicans do? I grew up in Texas and worked alongside illegals back in 1979 in a construction job one summer. There have been illegals flocking across the borders since the USA became a country. So, nice try to deflect, and maybe you should gander at how many have flocked here over all the years of republican Presidents.  Not just a Democrat Presidents issue. Nice try again. As for the economy, since I know you have no idea how the world works, but the COVID pandemic was and still is a worldwide issue. Countries besides the USA were shut down completely.  No workers out building things or working the lands. Inventories dried up in many industries, especially in necessities like food. Then we the USA opened up way earlier than most countries around the world, because we had the vaccines first, and Joe Biden pushed vaccinations hard. By doing that, the USA was able to open up much sooner. Had we had thumper still in charge, you would be waiting for your disinfectant injection longer, and you wouldn't need to drop an Ivermectin because COVID wouldn't kill you, but the disinfectant would. Yep, I bet you hide the fact that your BOY a PRESIDENT of the USA orated out loud to the world about looking into disinfectant injections and I will add using Nukes to try to blow hurricanes off course. Yep, your hero made the USA the laughing stock of the world. So, other economies are in worse shape than ours, and supply versus demand drives up prices. You would never learn that at tRump University.  Add in oil disruption around the world, and tack on collusion by OPEC to drive up oil prices.
